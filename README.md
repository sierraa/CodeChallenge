# CodeChallenge
24-hour code challenge for an interview implementing the rock-paper-scissors variant rock-paper-scissors-lizard-Spock (or RPSLS as I'll call it for short) as seen on the TV show Big Bang Theory.
## Rules

Scissors cuts paper and decapitates lizard.
Paper covers rock and disproves Spock.
Rock crushes scissors and lizard.
Lizard eats paper and poisons Spock.
Spock smashes scissors and vaporizes rock.

## How to install

From the command line after compiling the src folder with javac, simply run RPSLSMain to start the game. 

Alternatively, an executable jar file has been included which will begin play when double clicked.
